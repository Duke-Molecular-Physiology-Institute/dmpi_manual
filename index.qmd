# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a data analysis handbook for the [Duke Moleculary Physiology Institute (DMPI)](https://dmpi.duke.edu). The goal of this document is to identify common steps in analyzing 'omics datasets, to organize them in an understandable way, and to provide examples of how to perform the analysis steps using R.

For now, the content of this handbook is organized according to the order of operations one might perform when analyzing 'omics data. The first section contains examples of reading and writing data in R. The next sections detail common steps for preparing raw 'omics data for statistical analysis. The last sections present vignettes that illustrate basic statistical tests that can be applied to answer biological questions of interest.
